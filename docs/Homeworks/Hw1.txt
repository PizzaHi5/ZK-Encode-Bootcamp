Maths Introduction
Some modular arithmetic
1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
What is
a) 4 + 4 
-   Following the examples provided:
    4 + 4 = 8mod7 = 1
    7 = prime number order of finite field Z
b) 3 x 5
-   15mod7 = 1
c) what is the inverse of 3 ? =3?
-   Using Fermats Theorum,
    3^(7-2) = 243mod7 = 5

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?
-   Yes because S is a associative closed set containing identity and inverse elements combined with a binary operator '+'

3. What is
-13 mod 5 ?
-   In modular arithmetic for i + kN | k Ɛ Z where 0 <= i < N-1,
    -13%5 = (-13%5 + 5) % 5
            (-3 + 5) % 5
                2

4. Polynomials
For the polynomial
Find a the positive root ?
What is the degree of this polynomial ?
x
-   root = 0, 1st degree 
3 − x
-   root = 3, 1st degree
2 + 4x − 12
-   root = 5/2, 1st degree

Use cases
In your teams discuss any systems you have used that involved zero knowledge
proofs.
-   I have worked with Scroll and ZKSync. Won the Scroll bounty in EthDenver2023! These are zkEVMs that only require changing
    compiler to deploy to a different network. It was a pretty straight forward process once I figured it out with the guides help.

Have you seen any applications of zero knowledge proofs other than with a
blockchain ?
-   ZKPs were used with ZK-2FA. This was used to secure a private key when paired with an AA (account abstraction). 
    EOA deploys AA smart contract, all funds/usage is done thru this smart contract. To interact with this AA, all
    transactions must provide a 'password' thats checked thru a ZKP. 
    

What is to you, the most important feature of zkp technology ?
-   Rollups is a massive needed implementaiton in the crypto space. Cheap transactions are an essential building block
    for future more complex applications to be built on. Thats why we saw Perpetual Protocol required to deploy on optimism.
    Transactions were too expensive for mainnet due to all the logic/complexity involve with derivatives and TWAP computation
    requirements.

Think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs that you would like to see
developed.
-   I would like to see ZK-2FA become a reality. Being able to secure your private key with an extra layer of security incase
    your key becomes compromised is huge!
