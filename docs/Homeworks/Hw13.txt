Homework 13
Stark Theory
1. Imagine you get the following trace
    0,2,4,6,8,10,12
from your program (which simply adds 2 to the previous value.)
Write out the constraints for this trace, in terms of i, j

2. Polynomial practice
for p(x) = x^3 − 5x^2 − 4x + 20

a) find an integer root a , i.e. p(a) = 0 (clue < 7)
b) write this in terms of a lower degree polynomial q(x)
such as p(x) = (x − a)q(x)
What are the degrees of p(x) and q(x)?
Note we are doing this over the real numbers, for zkps we would use a finite
field
