Homework 3
Practice using Zokrates
Use Remix
Install the Zokrates plugin
1. Use the example file to generate a proof to show that a prover knows the
square root of 25.
-   Generated proof, got verifier.sol. Deployed verifier.sol, input verifyTx inputs => Got success! My prover knows 5*5=25.
    My input was this:
    [["0x0a150a0975c3dd10b35c67800275ab138c8f6b0dac28aa30e665aa9d4af0df57","0x25b20ee1cc9de77e2329ef4ef050b3858e0778cd527ce328a32c20d3fdadad9a"],
    [["0x1b224756ac6f9d72c0e5c138027bbaf6d281b3cb22b219a9ae6df422eb4c16a3","0x24c7e16b64c934dad487776c9fbc7524e9d6770b945125ec7f5a7c2e802d10e2"],
    ["0x2030765eed15b24a5956aa0b31b785fbbcac562d0d0d6fad53c3cee8452c202b","0x0127435e0874c0d80162ce02e003e266d8085f5e841e4a6299130406a8ad4ae6"]],
    ["0x1bc5ff509f79f034b2761aaa6d767f918373ed66334240ae4a3b75139551dca0","0x294ab31bfb89b7f3fe3bce1199ca36966764906adbc9d829c7ae6715e3488bc0"]],
    ["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000019"]

2. Try to create an invalid proof
-   To create an invalid ZK-proof, one or more of the 3 main properties of a valid ZKP must be incorrect. These being:
        Completeness, Soundness, and/or Zero-Knowledge
    Being able to create an invalid proof means that the attacker can gain access to information they should not have or manipulate validation
    breaking the underlying system. This is super bad!


. Follow the example to build a proof that you know the pre image of a hash
https://zokrates.github.io/examples/sha256example.html
-   I followed the tutorial and deployed locally. Saved the output contract to src/Hw3verifier.sol for future reference. Added some extra comments. 

. In principle how could you use Zokrates to verify that a certain address on
Ethereum has more than say 1 ETH ?
-   Using 2 fields, check the field balance >= field u32 (our 1000000000000000000). I am not sure exactly how to pull that data from on-chain
    currently.
