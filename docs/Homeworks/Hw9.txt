Homework 9
Noir
1. Follow the instructions to install Rust and Noir
( the nargo directory is in crates/nargo)
https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/nargo/installation.html
-   Got it installed! Check!

2. Create an example project
https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/hello_world.html
1. Create a new project
    nargo new hello_world
2. Build the project
    cd hello_world
    nargo check
3. Edit the inputs in the Prover.toml file
    x = "1" y = "2"
4. Edit the Verifier.toml as follows
    y = "2" setpub = []
5. Generate the proof
    nargo prove my_proof
6. Verify the proof
    nargo verify my_proof

-   Followed the steps listed above! Look in the noir/hello_world/ 
    folders in this repo. 'nargo verify p' worked successfully! 
    Woot woot! Got my first Noir program running! This went very
    smoothly compared to cairo. I also generated a smart contract
    with my verified program. Look in the contract folder.
