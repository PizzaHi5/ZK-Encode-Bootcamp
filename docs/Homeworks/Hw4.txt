Cairo
Remember if you are using protostar you cannot use serialise_word to output values,
you need to use hints instead.
. In the Cairo Playground use the Hello playground example
https://www.cairo-lang.org/playground/

a) Run the program and see the output in the console
-   Program output:
    10
    20
    410

    Number of steps: 21
    Program hash: 0x049a748653632ec760b53cb9830fb30e989b6a12fc8e15345fcb3ebfa79cf376

. Install Protostar, instructions are below, today we are only going to use
programs, so you do not need to write or deploy contracts.
-   Installed Protostar in protostar/ folder in this repo. Starting to get a feel for 
    the Cairo language in protostar framework. 

. Complete exercises in cairo/exercises/programs directory in this repo,
follow the instructions in the README file in the cairo directory. If you have
problems running the exercises, you can instead copy the code into the Cairo
playground and run them there.
