Homework 5
If you want to use gitpod, this is the format

. Make sure you can follow the recursion example on the Cairo playground
https://www.cairo-lang.org/playground/
. Does this example use tail recursion ?

. Install the Argent X wallet or Braavos wallet and create an account
https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/
https://braavos.app/
. How does this account differ to an Ethereum EOA ?
-   With group9 team, learned Braavos has AA so I am going with that. I like that compared to Metamask
    which I have been using since I started, there are many more convience features built into the wallet.
    For one, swaps are built in. Theres a nice UI to see NFTs. Once I finally bridged my L1 goerli eth to
    Starknet L2 which took several minutes (possibly hours), I got to deploy a separate AA contract and
    all my funds were transferred over. After digging around in Starknet for a while, I found some verified
    cairo smart contracts. Very different language compared to Solidity!

    In terms of difference to Ethereum EOA, it looks quite similar. Accounts still have addresses however they
    are handled as uint251 instead (felts). Its primarily the same to Ethereum but the underlying mechanisms/
    structure is different. 

Cairo Playground Exercises:
-   I ran thru the program exercises in the hw4 repo.
