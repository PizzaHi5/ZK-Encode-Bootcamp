Homework 8
. Discuss in your teams the need for confidential tokens
-   Basic financial privacy is similar to how bank accounts operate. Generally, ppL
    desire a certain level of financial confidentially. Confidential tokens can
    satisfy that need. 

. Have you / do you want to use ZCash or other confidential tokens ?
-   I have not used Zcash however I know of its existance. Knowing more about how it all
    works under the hood is what I am here to learn about :). I will definitely use a
    confidential token in the future. 

. The future for Aztec and private transactions on Ethereum in light of what has
happened to Tornado Cash.
-   I heard that there is a push to make all transactions being private on Ethereum.
    I do not think that would stop regulators. It would shift them to banning use of
    or the currency entirely. Related to Aztec, I suspect that having the option to
    privacy is essential however striking the right balance between privacy and transparency
    is going to be a different task to achieve. Some private transactions on ETH will
    be needed, thats for sure.

. Continue with the cairo program and cairo contract exercises in the repo
https://github.com/ExtropyIO/ZeroKnowledgeBootcamp
-   Finished up cairo programs, onto cairo contracts now that I understand the syntax much
    better. 3/27/23
