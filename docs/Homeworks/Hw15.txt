Homework 15
Using Circom REPL
See this partial circom code
https://gist.github.com/extropyCoder/fe99bf4b0094354edaf7b737b14ffa0f
Using this code in the zkREPL, complete the constraint on line 19 and add some
appropriate inputs in the input section.
Test that it creates a proof, and show that an incorrect proof fails.

-   Following guide in lesson 12 to setup circom and compile hw15
-   Downloaded circom, the 4th ZK language
-   Added constraint in line 19 and inputs
-   Put files generated from PLONK and Groth16 in Circom/Keys/
-   Circuit Hash:

        from verified groth16 zkey
-   I tested the proof would fail by changing a single value in the zkey file.
    Immediately failed to prove the value stating it was out-of-bounds. Not 
    having the correct proof will fail!
