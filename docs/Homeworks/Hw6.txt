-   Here we go! Worked a lot of hours on getting this to work! Got it! Wooooot Woot!
    In the repo specified above, go to: cairo/ and run:
    protostar test test/test_erc20.cairo
    and 
    protostar test test/test_storage.cairo
    
-   Both tests will succeed with the contracts found in this repo's directory:
    protostar/ZKencode/src/erc20/erc20.cairo
    and
    protostar/ZKencode/src/storage/storage.cairo

-   These 2 contracts were modified by me to meet the criteria specified in the ERC20 README in cairo.
