For a proof size, which of these would you want ?
-   For the complexity ratios below, the ideal ratio is O(1) since the time/space required to solve the
    polynomial is always the same no matter the inputs. SNARKS are ideal in this reguard. 

. What do you understand by
1. O(n)
-   The input size to time/space taken to solve the algebraic problem increases at n rate. Linear increase.
. O(1)
-   Complexity ratio is constant. Time/space required to solve will always remain the same. SNARKS have O(1)
    for verifier and proof size.
. O(log n)
-   Complexity increases at a log n rate. Bulletproof proof size increases at this rate. 


1. Modular arithmetic - you just need to find examples, you don't need to prove
anything.
-   "clock math" as they say. 

1. Is it true that all odd squares are â‰¡ 1 (mod 8) ?
-   Yes! Insane to look at the math for this. Surprised me.

. what about even squares (mod 8) ?
-   Even squares mod 8 = 0 or 4. Its one or the other given integer and even X.

. Try out the vanity bitcoin address example at asecurity or the Ethereum
version

-   This is very cool! I made my own vanity address! Wooooooo! Here is the vanity address I made!
