    zk example sudoku

Make sure you understand the logic flow within the app
-   Look in the mina/sudoku/ directory to see this homeworks effort. It was
    a straight forward process to run. I combed thru the code and I see why
    this is much more convienient to work with. Far easier to write with
    since it uses Typescript. Many new developers from web2 can jump in and 
    have an easier time getting into this over learning Solidity. Hardhat 
    uses js/ts to execute too. This is similar to how Foundry does everything
    in Solidity for Ethereum. Everything can be done in Typescript for Mina.
