# Highlights
I got learned a lot about the inner workings of ZK technology. This included learning the basics for programming cairo, noir, mina, and cirom. I learned the most about cairo. Here is a link to cairo folder in this repo:

## Useful Tools

Some useful tools I picked up along the way included using vanity addresses and warp to generate cairo contracts from Solidity.  

Heavy theory was covered in first 4 lessons and last 4 lessons.
